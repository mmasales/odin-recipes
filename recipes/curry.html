    <h2>Indian Chicken Curry</h2>
    <p>Chicken curry is common to several countries including India, countries in Asia and the Caribbean. 
    My favorite of them though is this aromatic Indian Chicken Curry, I'm always just craving these flavors.
    </p>

    <p>

        This has been the go-to dish I order at my local Indian restaurant so I finally just decided to recreate it at home and I couldn't be happier with the end result!
        I love that it has an abundance of spices leaving it with incredible flavor. I also love that little bit of cream that's added at the end, even though it's not much it works wonders.
        And of course it's got an abundance of sauce because that's what chicken curry is all about - that irresistible sauce for soaking up with naan bread or serving alongside rice.
